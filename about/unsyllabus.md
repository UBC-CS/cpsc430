## Computer-based testing facility (CBTF)

All of your essays this term will be written in the [CBTF](https://cbtf.ubc.ca) by booking slots in a proctored environment on UBC-provided computers.
Students can make reservations in the CBTF a few days in advance and can adjust their reservation times up to 30-minutes before the start of the reservation.
Watch [this video](https://cbtf.ubc.ca/students/reservations) to see a demo of the booking process.
Students will need to bring their Student IDs for each reservation and are not permitted any electronic devices while doing their exam.
More information about the CBTF procedures can be found [here](https://cbtf.ubc.ca/students/procedures).
Typically, Essays will have a 4-day window and Resubmissions will have a 2-day window.
Time slots will be available based on proctor availability and CBTF operational needs.
