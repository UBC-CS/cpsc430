## Essay Quiz Grading

Your essay will be graded between 0 and 5 in the following four dimensions.

1. Was the essay well structured, stating a thesis, supporting it with argument(s) that are clearly related to this point and (if relevant) distinct from one another, and linking these arguments in a logical way?
2. Did the essay do a good job of making its case, choosing relevant arguments, backing them up with evidence and examples at an appropriate level of detail, and responding to contrary views as appropriate?
3. Did the essay demonstrate a good understanding of the course's subject matter, including both the topic and the wider context?
4. Was the essay presented clearly and in correct English?

Evaluations on this five point scale will be translated into grades as follows.

| Grade | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| 0     | 0%         |
| 1     | 25%        |
| 2     | 50%        |
| 3     | 65%        |
| 4     | 80%        |
| 5     | 100%       |

For each essay quiz, you'll receive at least 3 peer reviews of your work (and will perform such reviews yourself; the number will depend on your participation in class the previous week, as described below).
These reviews will be double-blind: neither an essay's author nor its reviewer will know the other's identity.
Reviews will explain the rationale for your grade in each dimension, using at least 20 words.
 
Many, but not all, essays will be graded by TAs.
Whenever a TA grades your essay, only the TA grade will matter to your essay score, though you will still see your peer grades. Our system will select essays for TA evaluation based on a range of different factors.
Every time your peer graders have not yet demonstrated sufficient reliability, TAs will grade alongside them (thus overruling the grades they assign).
TAs will also conduct spot checks: when reviewers' scores substantially disagree; when essays receive unusually high scores; and entirely at random.
 
When no TA grades your essay, your grade will be computed as a weighted average of the grades assigned by your peers, where each peer's weight is proportional to our assessment of their "dependability": our belief about how much we can trust each score based on each grader's behaviour so far in the course (see below).
In cases where we consider a peer grade unreliable, we may assign it a weight of zero.
We will round your weighted average to the nearest integer grade in each dimension.
 
If you disagree with the grade you receive on any essay, you can appeal, explaining your concern in 100 words or more.
If you do not provide a convincing argument, a TA may reject your appeal without regrading your essay; however, you can refine your argument and resubmit the appeal.
If a TA regrades your assignment, you will receive the TA's grade regardless of whether it increases or decreases your score.
You can also flag rude or careless reviews and endorse high quality reviews if you'd like to bring them to the attention of TAs without asking for a change in your grade.
 
Even if your essay was not initially graded by a TA, we may flag it for later review, in which case we will override your peer grade with the TA-assigned grade. There are two key reasons we may do this.
First, if our inference algorithm updates its beliefs about your graders' dependability to an extent that your grade would change by two points or more, a TA will override your peer graders.
Second, if we become suspicious of a student's grading behaviour (e.g., because of appeals or other spot checks) we will go back and regrade other assignments this student has handled.
