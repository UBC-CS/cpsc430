# Resubmissions

This term we will be providing students with an opportunity to resubmit each Essay Quiz after receiving feedback from your peers.
The purpose of the resubmission is to engage with feedback you receive from your peers and address the comments with a resubmission.
In addition to submitting a new version of your essay, the resubmission process will also require you to formally reflect on the process and provide a detailed description of what you changed (see below for the questions you'll need to consider).
Resubmissions are optional - if you are happy with the feedback you received, you do not need to make a resubmission.

```{important}
Grades for your submissions are intentionally not released until after the resubmission period is over so you can do your resubmission based on the feedback you received. Your final submission scores will be released once the resubmission phase is complete and TAs have completed their reviews.

## Resubmission reflection

Please answer questions A, B, C, and D all in the one submission box that appears after prompt D.

### A. Summarize the feedback you received

In few sentences (point form is okay), summarize the feedback that you received on your initial submission from all of your peer-reviews. Be sure to include the strengths and weaknesses. Please do not copy/paste rubric items directly, we're interested in seeing your synthesis of the feedback.

### B. Summarize the changes you've made in this resubmission

In a couple of sentences (point form is okay), summarize the changes that you have made to your submission that warrants a resubmission request. Note: if your submission has not substantially improved, we reserve the right to reject the resubmission request and ask you to try again.

### C. Self-Assessment
What score do you feel you deserve on this essay? Add a score for each of the 4 rubric items.

1. **Structure**: Was the essay WELL STRUCTURED, stating a thesis, supporting it with argument(s) that are clearly related to this point and (if relevant) distinct from one another, and linking these arguments in a logical way?
2. **Argumentation**: Did the essay do a GOOD JOB OF MAKING ITS CASE, choosing relevant arguments, backing them up with evidence and examples at an appropriate level of detail, and responding to contrary views as appropriate?
3. **Subject matter**: Did the essay demonstrate a good UNDERSTANDING OF THE COURSE'S SUBJECT MATTER, including both the topic and the wider context?
4. **English**: Was the essay presented CLEARLY AND IN CORRECT ENGLISH?

### D. What have you learned from the feedback?

In few sentences, summarize what you have learned as a result of resubmitting your work. If your reflection here is not suitable, your resubmission request will not be accepted.
