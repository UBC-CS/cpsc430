In this section, I will outline any changes that have been made to the unsyllabus as we go through the course.
We will do our best to follow the plan outlined in this unsyllabus, but in case things go south, I will need to make adjustments to the contents and the schedule.

Any major changes to the syllabus (this page) will be documented here, as well as the date the change was made. 

| Change Date | Summary | Rationale |
