# Waitlist Policies

In the CPSC department, course instructors **are not in charge of the class waitlist** and have very little authority or influence over who will get into the course.
Course instructors also cannot assess your chances of getting into the class, or help you optimize them based on individual circumstances.
Please direct any questions you may have to the [CS Department Academic Advisors after consulting the FAQ on this page](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/waitlists).

1. Students who are active in class and who complete assigned essays and peer reviews will be given priority (attendance and participation information will be shared with the department); 

2. Students who register for the course late still have to complete all assignments on the same schedule as all other students. Waitlisted students are eligible to submit assignments and to perform peer review even before being formally registered.

```{tip}
If you are on the waitlist and want to take the course, to maximize your chances of being successful you should fully participate in the course from the very beginning.

**We anticipate submitting student participation and attendance with the department by 6 PM on May 15th, so decisions can be made by the Add/Drop deadline.**
