## Debate!


```{tip}
This class we will have a formal debate with prepared statements.
The topic is:

Be it resolved that (BIRT) Medical patents should be honoured even if they are costing human life.
```

Some of you will be (randomly) assigned a "role" to play (e.g., Patent Lawyer, CEO of a tech company, Average Citizen, etc...) but you will have some flexibility on whether you debate for or against the position.
Your position may change over the course of the debate (it's up to you) but before and after the debate, we will have a class vote to see where we stand on the issue.

Here's a nice short video on the importance of debate that you are encouraged to watch!

```

To prepare, you should spend some time thinking about and/or reading up about this topic.
You will get a little bit of time to prepare tomorrow but the more prepared you are, the more fruitful I expect the debate to be so be sure to look up facts, precedents, policies, and take note of them in so you have them all in one place for easy access.

Thanks, looking forward to this!
