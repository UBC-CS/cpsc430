Final Exam Information
=======================

This page contains the definitive information on the CPSC 430 Final Exam!

## Exam format

- The final exam will be 150 minutes long (2h30m).
    - Note: This is a strict duration and there will be no flexibility in time like with essay quizzes!
- Exam platform will be **PrairieLearn** (not MTA)!
- You are now able to [reserve sessions in the CBTF](https://ca.prairietest.com) between June 24th and June 26th.
    - Sessions will generally (subject to proctor availability) be held at 9 AM, 12PM, or 3 PM.
- The exam will be closed-book, no notes, no reference material etc will be needed; access to MTA will be restricted once the exam window begins
- There will be three parts to the exam:
    - Part 1: Conceptual multiple choice questions similar to the reading quiz questions (25%)
    - Part 2: Short answer questions that will take 1-3 sentences to answer fully (25%)
    - Part 3: Long Essay questions similar to your essays (50%)
- More details about each part is presented below

## Content Coverage

- Examinable material is everything we covered in class and all of the assigned readings and Chapters 2-10 of the textbook
- You will need to know how to write essays arguing for a position
- You will need to know how to write an essay outline
- You will need to be comfortable arguing from all of the workable ethical theories
- You will need to be familiar with the unworkable ethical theories, and why they are unworkable
- You will NOT need to memorize random facts and figures from the textbook

## How to prepare for the final exam

I'll provide some more details on each of the three parts.

### Part 1 (Conceptual Multiple Choice - 25%)

- Go through the Reading Quiz questions again and test yourself
- Don't worry too much about random facts, numbers, dates, but you should have some idea of key personalities the book discusses (e.g., John Locke)
- Do NOT bother re-reading the textbook, this will likely be a waste of your time!
- The questions for this part will be sampled from the Reading Quiz questions (though we make no guarantees that there will be no additional questions)

### Part 2 (Short Answer Questions - 25%)

- On MTA we have released a list of over 80 possible short answer questions and all questions for Part 2 of the exam are guaranteed to come from this list
- You will NOT have any choice in which Part 2 questions you have to answer
- Each student will get a different set of questions, and they must answer all of the ones they were assigned
- Each short-answer question should be answerable in 1-3 sentences
- You should prepare by being able to answer all of the questions from the list (if you have been keeping up with the course content, you should be able to answer most of these already without studying, though I still suggest going through them in some random order to make sure your answers are refined)

### Part 3 (Essays - 50%)

- On MTA we have released 4 potential prompts and on the final exam, **you will choose 2** of these prompts to write an outline and an essay.
- Your essays need to be a **minimum** of 2000 characters, but there is no maximum.
    - Yes, you read that right, there is no maximum length, but this does not mean you should write as much as you can - sometimes less is more!
- The outline will be graded, should be in point-form, and also has no word or character limit. Here is the rubric for the outline:
    - 0%: No outline provided, or what was provided wasn't recognizable as an outline.
    - 33% % : Weak outline: Possible key flaws: thesis is not clear; not hierarchically organized; more like sentences than point form; doesn't correspond closely to the essay; key ideas from the essay do not appear in the outline or vice versa.
    - 67% % : Good outline: Some flaws, but they were not serious. Corresponds to the essay reasonably closely; captures the essay's thesis and key ideas; roughly appropriate length; hierarchically organized.
    - 100 % : Excellent outline: Very closely corresponds to the essay; precisely describes the essay's thesis and key ideas; written in point form with no extraneous verbiage (anything shorter would lose important information); hierarchical organized.
- The essay will be graded (same rubric that you're used to) and must resemble your outline.

```{warning}
You must clearly indicate which two prompts you are choosing (by leaving the prompts you are not choosing blank and unanswered). If the teaching team is unclear on which prompts you've chosen, we will simply pick the first two.
```

## PrairieLearn

For a variety of reasons (no timer in MTA, no ability to randomize prompts and questions, increased cohesion with PrairieTest bookings, audit logs of student check-in and behaviour on the exam) we will be writing our final exam on PrairieLearn.
Though I admit this is a slight inconvenience, note that in the past, CPSC 430 final exams have been administered on paper, all at the same time (!!).
So to allow you the flexibility of being able to write the final exam at a more convenient time, distributed over 3 days, we needed to revisit the assessment platform.

I have recorded a quick video to give you an orientation of the assessment platform, it's fairly intuitive but watch the video anyway!
